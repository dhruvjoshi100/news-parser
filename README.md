Customize different sections of your news feed according to news channels of your choice.

This was originally meant to be an XML parser for a single RSS feed.

Configure different news sections by placing RSS feed link of the news website of your choice in "source" file of its respective sub-folder (found in "news" folder).

Current functionality supports XML parsing and saving the data into a CSV file ONLY.

UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
